Welcome to Power-RTI! This is a PowerShell Module that can help automate creating and managing Real-Time Intelligence Environments. The repository is a curated collection of PowerShell cmdlets to help you to standardize management and provisioning of Fabric RTI resources.

Sending KQL Commands to a KQL-Database is a little bit complex so I wrote an article on how to do this. The article can be found [here](./documentation/querying-a-kql-database.md).

## Generating the documentation

The documentation for the cmdlets is created through [platyPS](https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS) and is stored in the folder [documentation](./documentation/). This documentation will be created automatically by running the script [createdocumentation.ps1](./helper/createdocumentation.ps1).

| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **The documentation will be created from the module which was loaded into PowerShell. It will not be created from the files directly. All what is needed is in the file [createdocumentation.ps1](./helper/createdocumentation.ps1)** |

## Interesting Links for reference

During the development of the module and the research I do I might pass some interesting documentation. I collect it here for reference.

## Questions

In this section I just collect questions that I stumble upon and that have to be addressed somehow.

- Is there no New-Command for KQLQuerysets?
- Why do you need admin permission to read the workspaces?
